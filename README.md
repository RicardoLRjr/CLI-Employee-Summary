## Installation Instructions:

It is plug and play. Just pop it and the included files with it in a directory and it will work!

## Usage Instructions:

Follow the onscreen instructions, and you will be prompted to answer a series of inquiries. After answering the
the employee's name, email, and work ID, you will be prompted to select the role for that employee. If the employee
is an engineer, you can enter their GitHub username. If they are an intern, you can enter their university, and
if they are a fellow manager, you can enter their office number. Once you have entered that information, you will be prompted if you want to add another employee. If you select yes, you will be returned to the beginning of the application. However, if you select no, the application will then build a webpage featuring profiles for the employees who were entered in using a set of provided templates. This application makes use of classes and a rendering function to make this process easier.
